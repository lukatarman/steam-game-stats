# Steam Game Stats

"Steam Game Stats" project monorepo. Frontend and backend readme files can be found in:

- [frontend/README.md](frontend/README.md)
- [backend/README.md](backend/README.md)

## Development Setup

For development and testing the application locally use the Docker Compose setup. Either connect to a MongoDB running in a container or to a remote MongoDB instance. See details below on how to do that.

**Step 1.**, install:

- [Node.js v18.17.x](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.17.1/).
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other code editor.
- [MongoDB extension](https://www.mongodb.com/products/vs-code) to test your queries if you use VSCode.

**Step 2.**:

- check out code from this repo

**Step 3.1**, local setup:

- For the local db setup create a `local-db.env` in the root folder in the `config` directory:

```bash
# ./config/local-db.env
DB_ENDPOINT="mongodb://mongodb:27017"
DB_USERNAME="<local-db-username>"                # pick a username
DB_PASSWORD="<local-db-password>"                # generate using: openssl rand -base64 16
DB_NAME="<local-db-name>"                        # pick a db name
DB_AUTH_ON="true"

MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME="root"
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD="<local-db-password>" # generate using: openssl rand -base64 16
MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE="<local-db-name>"          # same as DB_NAME

LOG_LEVEL="debug"

FEATURES_BATCH_SIZE=5
FEATURES_BATCH_DELAY=5000                        # ms
FEATURES_UNIT_DELAY=800                          # ms
FEATURES_CURRENT_PLAYERS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_DELAY=2 # h
FEATURES_UPDATE_INTERVAL_DELAY=12                # h
FEATURES_ITERATION_DELAY=5000                    # ms

RUNNER_ITERATION_DELAY=5000                      # ms
```

**Step 3.2**, cloud setup:

- create a free tier [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register)
- add your IP to the access list in the [MongoDB Atlas dashboard](https://cloud.mongodb.com)
- get the connection uri from the same dashboad under `deployment > database`, then clicking the `connect` button and then `shell`, the uri should look something like this: `mongodb+srv://a-database-name.wml8hrs.mongodb.net/`
- there is a small bug in MongoDB Atlas with the first user which is created when the account is created, so create a second user and use the second user to connect
- store the password in a password manager upon creation of the user otherwise you have to overwrite it
- get the username under `security > database access`
- for the cloud db setup create a `cloud-db.env` in the root folder in the `config` directory:

```bash
# ./config/cloud-db.env
DB_ENDPOINT="<cloud-db-endpoint>"                # set accordingly
DB_USERNAME="<cloud-db-username>"                # set accordingly
DB_PASSWORD="<cloud-db-password>"                # set accordingly
DB_NAME="<cloud-db-name>"                        # set accordingly
DB_AUTH_ON="true"

MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME="<unset>"             # not used but must have a value in cloud setup
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD="<unset>"             # not used but must have a value in cloud setup
MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE="<unset>"                  # not used but must have a value in cloud setup

LOG_LEVEL="debug"

FEATURES_BATCH_SIZE=3
FEATURES_BATCH_DELAY=30000                       # ms
FEATURES_UNIT_DELAY=2000                         # ms
FEATURES_CURRENT_PLAYERS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_DELAY=2 # h
FEATURES_UPDATE_INTERVAL_DELAY=12                # h
FEATURES_ITERATION_DELAY=30000                   # ms

RUNNER_ITERATION_DELAY=30000                     # ms
```

## Running the Application

The application is packaged in containers using Docker Compose. The current setup contains the backend and the database. Adding the frontend to the setup is pending.

There are two simple ways to start the containers:

1. NPM Scripts
1. VSCode Tasks

### NPM Scripts

Start application using the local db:

```bash
npm run start:backend:local-db
```

Start application using the cloud db:

```bash
npm run start:backend:cloud-db
```

Stop the application (cloud or local):

```bash
npm stop
```

The rest api is exposed under [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### VSCode Tasks

- open the "Show All Commands" search bar
- type "`run task`" and hit enter
- type "`Docker:`" and select start with local-db or cloud-db or stop
- the task with `debug` in its name is used for the debugging configuration

## Debugging

The debugging configuration is only available for VSCode. You can debug the backend, unit tests and integration tests locally from the VSCode debugger menu by selecting one of the three configurations starting with "`Local: ...`".

For debugging the application in the Docker container select the configuration starting with "`Docker: ...`". This configuration will rebuild the backend image, start the Docker Compose setup with Node.js in debug mode and attach itself to it so that you can set breakpoints in VSCode. When you are finished debugging detach the debugger and the configuration will stop and clean up the containers.

The Docker debugging configuration uses the `local-db.env` file for the db setup. For more info on the debugging configuration check the `launch` and `tasks` sections in `.vscode/steam-game-stats.code-workspace`.
